After learning about the start of Bridgewater Associates, have some feelings and I will write here and try my best to do the same for that company.
I am going to read more about the book Principle. 
This company is really interesting that only 30% if staff stay there after getting inside within 30 days:
As the company allows staff to scold each other in their face and it is prohibited to scold without seeing each other which is really an interesting perspective



Try to find a portfolio in different circumstances. 
four different circumstances in allocating capital:
1. rising and growth
2. rising but inflation
3. down but growth 
4. down but inflation
From things I learned recently, it is commonly admitted that bonds perform well when economy doesn't show to be good; Stock work better when the economy booms

I am going to see more about the company and write more

That is a shortly off 
---------------------------------

Used to hear that the first private equity fund change from Bridgewater Associates to another one, BUT I always believe that the longer you live, the better you are. 

That is another comment for this company.  
-----------------------------------
Their original process of earning money, one way is to sign a file to McDonald's. 
At that time, McDonald's approached Bridgewater Associates because it was dissatisfied with the chicken nugget supplier's requirement to sign long-term orders and hoped to find a solution. After splitting the composition of chicken nuggets, Bridgewater Associates found that the original price ratio of chicks was very low. The cost of chicken nuggets was mainly the price of feed, including corn and soybean meal. As long as two commodities are made into futures, physical risks can be hedged.
This really a really good example of separating risk.
